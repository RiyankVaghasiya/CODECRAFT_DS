# CODECRAFT_DS_01

This repository contains tasks and projects completed as part of the CODECRAFT_DS_01 initiative. The goal is to explore data science concepts and implement them in Python. One of the key tasks in this project is creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as ages or genders in a population.


# CODECRAFT_DS_02

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.
